As test, basically check first few print outs in file
Best so far is uint8count_counts.txt:
2798ms, 3273ms, 4502ms, ...

Results:
checking for zero with an if statement in loop instead of adding: bad
uint8 for count_counts array: good
uint8 for counts array: bad
big preallocated array instead of array of vectors: bad, probably (could try optimizing later)
